Tackling this Issue: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/797

Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emily: Development environment is set up, can I can run test apps.
Nada: Development enviroment is up and running and can run test app. 

Goal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are going to implement the following use cases:
  1. As an android developer, I would like better control over keyboard popups [Emily]
  2. As a Selendroid client, it would be easier to automate closing the keyboard instead of pressing the back button. 

Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup debugger for Selendroid so we can step through code. [Nada and Emily]
2. Debug keyboard pop-up by making running test case causing keyboard to pop up. [Nada and Emily]
3. Read reference docs posted on Github under issues [Emily and Nada]
4. Begin designing the flow of control for feature. [Emily and Nada]
5. Before coding, submit to Luke design for feature [Nada]
6. Start coding feature! [Nada and Emily]
