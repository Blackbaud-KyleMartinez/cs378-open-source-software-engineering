## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making code changes.
I will attempt to add this feature https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/300

## Goal
To tackle this issue I need to:

* Reproduce the environment in the issue.

* With an implentation show that the end user can easily use the feature with no hiccups.

## Plan
1. Examine the alternative solution in the code and as well the selenium docs of what the function is supposed to do. 
1. Attempt to recreate the environment, which is a modal dialog in javascript which refreshes the page. This might require making a test app.
1. Implement the driver.manage().timeouts().PageLoadTimeout(), possibly using calls to the TestWaiter class.
1. Verify the solution works in the test environment.
