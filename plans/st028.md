## Status

I am good to go with my development environment. I have three things that I am working on right
now:
* I have two different issues geotrellis/issues/973 and geotrellis/issues/929
* I am helping Kevin with geotrellis/pull/1015
* Continue to learn scala

## Goal

My goal this week is to:
  1. Write test cases for 973
  2. Figure out the resample code for 929 so you know what to test
  3. Figure out where to put the tests for pr 1015
  4. Do the functional programming problems on Hackerrank

## Plan

My plan for work this week is to:
  1. Get in touch with Rob on where the test cases for 973 should go
    * After that I'll write the tests, pulling heavily from LocalMapSpec in the engine-tests project
  2. Get in touch with Rob about what format/location the test cases of 1015 should be
    * After that I'll write the tests
  3. Run the tests for the Tile trait implementers and look for the results that Rob alluded to in the issue.
    * I need to figure out what this function does
    * I'll probably add some prints to the tests so the results are more clear
  4. Do functional programming problems when you have time
