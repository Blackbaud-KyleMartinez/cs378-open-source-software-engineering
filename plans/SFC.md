EVERYONE HAS TO LEARN SCALA FIRST.

## Status

We have our development environment set up.
We are currently studying and learning Scala.
We are also looking at GeoHash code which is written in Scala. 
We are trying to write our own Hilbert Curve from Chris's Java code. 

## Goal

* We want to create a common API for space filling curves e.i, Z-curve, Hilbert Curve, etc.

* We would like to test each space filling curves' functionality and performance.  

## Plan

1. Be proficient at Scala and notion of various space filling curves.
1. Get familiar with Chris's Java code for Hilbert Curve and re-implement it in Scala in order to compare it with GeoHash's Z-order Curve.
1. Read academic papers sent from Jim.
1. Implement simple unit tests.
