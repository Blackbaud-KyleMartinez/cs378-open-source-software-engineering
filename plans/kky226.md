## Status

### Pull Requests
I have a PR merged in for [implicit Geometry sequence operations (#991)](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/991), and another in progress with Sam to maintain [immutability of JTS Geometry wrappers (#1015)](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis/pull/1015).

### Cassandra Integration
I have also set up my development environment for Apache Spark+Cassandra, and will transition towards working on Cassandra integration into GeoTrellis. I have a [spike project](https://github.com/kyeah/geotrellis-cassandra) up to play with RDDs in Cassandra.

## Goal

Adding Cassandra support to GeoTrellis serves several purposes:

* At worst, GeoTrellis will be able to support users who wish to store their data in Cassandra clusters and utilize GeoTrellis for high-performance operations.

* At best, the GeoTrellis team expects Cassandra to perform better than Accumulo and Hadoop/HDFS, and the GeoTrellis project can transition towards using Cassandra as the main datastore.

## Plan

### This week

1. I will finish modifying the immutability tests for #1015 with feedback from Rob and Sam.

2. I will continue researching Cassandra and working on the spike project to understand how Cassandra works and how raster/vector data can be ingested.

3. I will discuss the properties of Cassandra with Rob and plan out an initial driver/framework for Cassandra in GeoTrellis, following the style of the Hadoop and HDFS drivers.

* After meeting with Rob over Hangouts, we have discussed the core structures for GeoTrellis's Accumulo and HDFS integrations, and over the next week I will begin implementing the CassandraAttributeCatalog, CassandraMetadataCatalog, and CassandraCatalog classes for saving and loading RasterRDDs into Cassandra.

### Following weeks

1. I will create an initial driver/framework for Cassandra using raster RDDs.

2. I will form unit tests and benchmarks for the driver to compare its performance against Accumulo and HDFS.

3. I will share my initial implementation and benchmarks with Rob and the other project maintainers through a PR and iterate to improve RasterRDD support + add SpaceTimeKey support, if time permits.
