## Status

I have my development environment up.
I created a wiki page for IOS-driver(Luke suggested): https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/wiki/Getting-Starting-Developing-With-Ios-driver
using the document of our team: https://docs.google.com/a/utexas.edu/document/d/1BqVTZTWTzlAflnVKz6f1XNBpqFxvrqAkLQaY3u1z0ss 

## Goal

* Mainly focusing on the travis-ci build error and try to make it work
* Fixing the test cases when building the environment
* figuring out and fixing issues in IOS-driver gitHub

## Plan

1. I am going to run the build code in my machine and trace the error from there.
1. I will run fix the test cases in the development environment to make them passed.
1. Besides, I will also take a look at the issues on IOS-driver GitHub and see if I can fix anything.
1. If I finish anything above, I will send to our team to check and make pull requests after that.
