## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making code changes.
Need to pull in changes made by Kevin and Phillip so that the app uses Openlayers instead of Leaflet.

## Goal

I am hoping to accomplish the following:

* Finish up the UI changes for the baseball cards portion of the application.

* Get geoserver data to populate into the baseball cards whenever a user clicks on a marked spot on the map.

## Plan

I am planning to:

* I need to fix an issue pertaining to the scroll buttons. If I am stuck on this, I will contact the UI experts for help.

* I will look into the technicalities of the WMS calls to understand how data from geoserver is obtained.

* I will investigate the code Jim sent me that will help me get started wi th obtaining geoserver data.

* With an appropriate understanding, I should be able to work on getting the data into the cards.
