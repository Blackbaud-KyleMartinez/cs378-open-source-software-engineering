## Status

I have my development environment up and feel relatively comfortable making code changes. I'm still
getting comfortable programming in Scala, but I'm much better at reading and understanding existing code.

## Goal

* Continue mastering Scala
* Create a common interface for different implementations of space filling curves
* Find and implement other space filling curves

## Plan

1. Continue work on coursera Scala course
1. Understand and implement Chris Bennight's space filling curve code in Scala
1. Do research on both space filling curves that aren't z-space or Hilbert curves and implementations
that are different than geomesa/geotrellis curves
1. Read up on information sent by Jim
