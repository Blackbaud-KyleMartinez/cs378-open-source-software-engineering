## Status

I have my development environment up and feel comfortable making code changes.

## Goal

I am going to implement the following use cases:

* As an ios-driver developer, I would like the unit tests to pass

* As an iOS app developer, I would like to be able to test location aware apps by simulating specific locations.

## Plan

1. I am going to keep running & fixing the test cases in my development environment until they are passing.
1. I am then going to share my code with Chris Brubaker to see if he can reproduce
1. I will then submit a pull request for the working unit tests.  I will include documentation changes to remove the `-DskipTests`

1. I will research the iOS API for location awareness
1. I will see if Selenium has any location protocol.  If not, I will write up a proposal and send it to the project for comment.
1. I will implement my proposed protocol for iOS and write test cases that exercise the functionality.
